The mathematical proof, data, and code for The Joule Standard: A thermodynamic theory of monetary evolution ($G \cdot E = k$).

This repository contains the data, code, and mathematical proof for the **Joule Standard**, a new economic theory proposing that the granularity of money is physically determined by the energy density of civilization.

## The Discovery
Analysis of 10,000 years of economic history—from Neolithic social credit to the modern digital grid—reveals a strict inverse power law (**Slope ≈ -0.999**, **R² ≈ 0.99**) between:
1.  **Energy Cost (E):** The labor hours required to capture 1 Gigajoule of energy.
2.  **Monetary Granularity (G):** The purchasing power of the smallest socially trusted accounting unit.

**The Law:** As energy becomes cheaper (technologically abundant), money *must* become more divisible (granular) to maintain thermodynamic equilibrium. Systems that violate this law (e.g., the 20th-century Gold Standard) collapse or undergo phase transitions.
